<h4> <center>Surroundings</center> </h4> The town of Balatonkenese is located at the northeastern tip of Lake Balaton, 100 km southwest of Budapest, on the Kenese High Shore. Among the Balaton settlements, it has a very unique location, as it is neither truly southern nor northern shore. From the high shore, especially from the Soós Hill lookout and a significant part of the direct waterfront, the entire eastern basin of Lake Balaton up to the Tihany Peninsula is well visible. Balatonkenese can be an attractive destination for those seeking relaxation not only during the summer beach season but also in the spring-autumn period, offering numerous hiking and excursion opportunities in the Balaton Uplands. In winter, it can be an ideal starting point for those seeking active recreation, partly due to the proximity of the Vibe Park ski arena in Eplény. <br />
